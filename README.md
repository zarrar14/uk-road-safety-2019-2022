# UK Road Safety Analysis (2019–2022)
**BUSM7105 – Business Analytics in Practice**  
**Project Option Chosen:** 4) Impacts of Weather and Road Conditions on Accident Rates

## Overview
This repository contains the dataset, Tableau workbook, and final report for our analysis of UK road accidents (2019–2022), focusing on:
- Weather conditions (fine/dry vs adverse)
- Road surface conditions
- Road type (single-carriageway vs others)
- Evidence-backed interventions to reduce casualties

### Key Findings
- Most accidents occur in **good (fine, dry) weather**, not during adverse weather.
- **Single-carriageway roads** account for the highest number of accidents in our dataset.
- **Dualling** (converting single to dual carriageway) and average-speed enforcement are supported by evidence to reduce severe crashes.
